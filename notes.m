% 1) ter is the non-decision time in seconds. This meaurement inlcudes the
% time that it takes to encode the stimulus (Te) and the time that it takes
% to execute a response (Tr). ter typically falls between 0.1 - 0.5s.
% 
% 2) a is the boundary seperation. It is the distance that that the
% diffusion has to travel to reach a threshold. This is measured in
% arbitrary units and typically falls between 0.5 - 2. 
%
% 3) z is variable that encodes bias. It goes from 0 to 1, where 0 is
% fully biased towards one decision, 1 is biased towards another decision,
% and 0.5 is an unbiased starting point.
